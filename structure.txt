 === Compressed file structure ===
    - Original file size [32 bits, 4 bytes] (maximum 2^32 bytes can be encoded)
    - Original file checksum [16 bytes] (using md5)
    - Beginning of payload, end of dictionary [32 bits, 4 bytes] (will use only if the dictionary is of varying size)
    - Payload size in bytes [32 bits]
    - Dictionary [256 bytes]

TODO:
    - Maybe store the filename to restore it
    - Create a separator for dictionary entries if storing more than one byte per entry
