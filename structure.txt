    - Original file size [32 bits, 4 bytes] (maximum 2^32 bytes can be encoded)

    - Dictionary size [4 bytes]
    - Dictionary [* bytes] (varying size)
    - Payload size in bytes [32 bits]
    - Compressed payload

TODO:
    - Maybe store the filename to restore it
    - Create a separator for dictionary entries if storing more than one byte per entry

=== New format of the compressed file ===

    - Dictionary [varying size]
    - Payload
